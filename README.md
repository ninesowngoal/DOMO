# DOMO
Domo is a discord bot originally made for personal use.

She is an admin bot that is currently able to:
  * Ban and kick (multiple) users with specific reasons for the kick/ban.
  * Log her own activity in a text channel. For example, who she has kicked or banned.
  * Send a DM to the person that invited her, with an overview of her capabilities.

## Installation
If you wish to install this bot, download the code as a zip file from the dropdown menu.

In each command, event and cog, there are parts of the code that you will need to edit. You will need to edit the config.json file too.

Extract the zip file wherever you wish.

Make sure to edit the config.json file with your bot token (you will have to make a bot on the discord developer site).

Be advised that the bot is for personal use and so may not work correctly when you use it.

In the future, I plan to make a public release version.
