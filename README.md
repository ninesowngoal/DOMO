# DOMO
Domo is a discord bot made for personal use.
She is an admin bot that is currently able to:
  *Ban and kick users with specific reasons for the kick/ban.
  *Track exp and level of users in a server.
  *Give roles to users when they react to a specific message with a specific emoji.
  *Log who joins/leaves voice calls.
  *Log who joins/leaves a server.
  *Send a welcome DM.

## Installation
If you wish to install this bot, download the code as a zip file from the dropdown menu.

Extract the zip file wherever you wish.

Make sure to edit the config.json file with your bot token (you will have to make a bot on the discord developer site) and guild (server) id.

Be advised that the bot is for personal use and so may not work correctly when you use it.

In the future, I plan to make a public release version.
